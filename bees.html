    <p id="bees-info"><b>Bees</b>> are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, 
        in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. 
        Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, 
        called Anthophila. There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families. 
        They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains 
        insect-pollinated flowering plants.</p>
